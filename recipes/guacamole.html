        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Guacamole is a delicious treat to have any time of year and is so much easier than you think it is to make. Just a few simple ingredients and you have the best snack for your guests or yourself. Just be sure you know how to pick the right avocados, no one likes getting home to make guacamole and realizing you have less or no green buddies to work with!</p>

        <p>Note that while having a masher is helpful, your most important tool is going to be a chefs knife. If you don't know how to open an avocado, simple smack your knifes blade vertically into the center of it, making sure you make contact with the pit. Once you're sure you're locked in, simply rotate the avocado along the knife's edge until you're back where you're started, then rotate both edges and voila! To remove the pit, you can smack the knife into it once more and slowly ease it out. Just be careful, if you have a dull knife or a flimsy one, you could slip and hurt yourself!</p>
