        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Ever wanted to know how to make Bird Rock's special sauce they use with their breakfast sandwich? Well look no further because I have all the secrets! This recipe is made for a bulk kitch setting but it can easily be downscaled if you keep the ratios consistent.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>840g mayonnaise</li>
            <li>240g honey dijon mustard</li>
            <li>40g dijon</li>
            <li>1 full bottle of cholula, or about 150g</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Using a kitchen scale, grab a large enough mixing bowl, tare out your scale, and weigh out the mayo</li>
            <li>Tare your scale once more and add the honey dijon mustard</li>
            <li>Tare your scale again and add the dijon</li>
            <li>Finally, add your cholula</li>
            <li>Mix by hand until the sauce seems to become consistent. You can finish here or, as an additional step, use an immersion blender to make it extra smooth</li>
          </ol>
